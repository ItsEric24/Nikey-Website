# Built a Nikey website with Tailwind CSS and React and Vite

I didn't know how to use Tailwind CSS, so I tried using the tool to help speed up my development process instead of wasting time trying to come up with class names for my CSS styles.

I hopped on the Tailwind Docs and began playing around with the tool's capabilities, then I was able to wrap my head around some of the tool's features and that's when I decided to try out this Nikey landing page to see more of what this tool can do.

I can't say I am a pro yet, but I love that I didn't stress out trying to come up with CSS class names for styling when Tailwind provides you with class names that you can write and immediately styles are applied.

I am looking to learn more about what I can do with Tailwind, and make better designs for my projects.
