# Built a Nikey website with tailwind css and Raect and Vite

I didn't know how to use Tailwind css, so i tried using the tool to help speed up my development process instead of wasting time try to come up with class names for my CSS styles.

I hoped on the Tailwind Docs and began playing around with the tool's capabilities, then i was able to wrap my head around some of the tool's features and that's when i decided to try out this Nikey landing page to see more of what this tool can do.

I cant say am a pro yet, but i really love the fact that i didn't stress out trying to come up with CSS class names for styling when Tailwind provides you with class names that you can write and immediately styles are applied.

Am looking to learn more about what i can do with Tailwind, and make better designs for my projects.
